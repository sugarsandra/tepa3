For the project of Scary Detector with Raspberry PI B+ and Python

# Description

Using materials such as Raspberry Pi B + we will implement an automatic robot that will act as an alarm. 
This robot will scan the people it sees, and when it comes across to an unknown presence,
a speaker will produce loud sounds to alert for any intruders.

# For this project the hardwear we'll use is:

   1. Raspberry Pi B+ (Cost: 50€)
   2. Thin Speaker (Cost: 0,50 €)
   3. ElecFreaks HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Module Distance (Cost: 2€)
   4. RGB LED (Cost: 0,20€)
   5. Servo Module (Generic) (Cost: 6€)
   6. Voltage Amplifier - LM38 (Cost: 1€)
   7. Kingston Canvas Select microSDHC 16GB U1 with Adapter (Cost: 3,50€)
